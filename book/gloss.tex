\item[absolute error]:
The absolute value of the difference between a mathematical value
and its finite approximation in a computer.

\item[absolute path]:
A \gl{path}{g:path} that refers to a
particular location in a file system. Absolute paths are usually written
with respect to the file system's \gl{root
directory}{g:root-directory}, and begin with either ``/'' (on Unix) or
``\textbackslash{}'' (on Microsoft Windows). See also:
\gl{relative path}{g:relative-path}.

\item[access control list] (ACL):
A list of permissions attached to a file or directory
that specifies who can do what with it.

\item[additive color model]:
A way to represent colors as the sum of
contributions from primary colors such as \gl{red, green,
and blue}{g:rgb}.

\item[aggregation function]:
A function such as \texttt{sum} or
\texttt{max} that combines many values to produce a single result.

\item[alias] (a library):
To give a \gl{library}{g:library} a
nickname while importing it.

\item[assertion]:
An expression which is supposed to be true at a
particular point in a program. Programmers typically put assertions in
their code to check for errors; if the assertion fails (i.e., if the
expression evaluates as false), the program halts and produces an error
message. See also: \gl{invariant}{g:invariant},
\gl{precondition}{g:precondition},
\gl{postcondition}{g:postcondition}.

\item[assignment]:
To give a value a name by associating a variable
with it.

\item[atomic value]:
A value that cannot be decomposed into smaller
pieces. For example, the number 12 is usually considered atomic (unless
we are teaching addition to school children, in which case we might
decompose it into tens and ones).

\item[branch]:
A "parallel universe" in a \gl{version control}{g:version-control} \gl{repository}{g:repository}.
Programmers typically use branches to isolate different sets of changes from one another during development
so that they can concentrate on one problem at a time.
See also: \gl{merge}{g:repository-merge}.

\item[call stack]:
A data structure inside a running program that
keeps track of active function calls. Each call's variables are stored
in a \gl{stack frame}{g:stack-frame}; a new stack frame is put on
top of the stack for each call, and discarded when the call is finished.

\item[cascading delete]:
The practice of automatically deleting things
in a database that depend on a record when that record is deleted. See
also: \gl{referential integrity}{g:referential-integrity}.

\item[case insensitive]:

characters were the same. See also: \gl{case
sensitive}{g:case-sensitive}.

\gl{committed}{g:commit} to a \gl{version
control}{g:version-control} \gl{repository}{g:repository} in a single operation.

\item[clone] (a repository):
To make a local copy of a \gl{version control}{g:version-control} \gl{repository}{g:repository}.

\item[comment]:
A remark in a program that is intended to help human
readers understand what is going on, but is ignored by the computer.
Comments in Python, R, and the Unix shell start with a \texttt{\#}
character and run to the end of the line; comments in SQL start with
\texttt{-{}-}, and other languages have other conventions.

\item[conditional statement]:
A statement in a program that might or
might not be executed depending on whether a test is true or false.

\item[conflict]:
A change made by one user of a
\gl{version control system}{g:version-control} that is
incompatible with changes made by other users. Helping users
\gl{resolve}{g:resolve} conflicts is one of version control's
major tasks.

\item[cross product]:
A pairing of all elements of one set with all
elements of another.

\item[current working directory]:
The directory that
\gl{relative paths}{g:relative-path} are calculated from;
equivalently, the place where files referenced by name only are searched
for. Every \gl{process}{g:process} has a current working
directory. The current working directory is usually referred to using
the shorthand notation \texttt{.} (pronounced ``dot'').

\item[cursor]:

outstanding operations.

\item[data type]:
A kind of data value, such as
\gl{integer}{g:integer} or \gl{character string}{g:string}.

interactive sessions.

\item[documentation]:
Human-language text written to explain what
software does, how it works, or how to use it.

\item[dotted notation]:
A two-part notation used in many programming
languages in which \texttt{thing.component} refers to the

\item[empty string]:
A character string containing no characters,
often thought of as the ``zero'' of text.

\item[encapsulation]:

implementation details so that the rest of a program can worry about
\emph{what} it does rather than \emph{how} it does it.

\item[exception]:
An event that disrupts the normal or expected execution of a program.
Most modern languages record information about what went wrong
in a piece of data (also called an exception).
See also: \gl{catch}{g:catch-exception}, \gl{raise}{g:raise-exception}.

\item[filename extension]:
The portion of a file's name that comes
after the final ``.'' character. By convention this identifies the
file's type: \texttt{.txt} means ``text file'', \texttt{.png} means
``Portable Network Graphics file'', and so on. These conventions are not
enforced by most operating systems: it is perfectly possible to name an
MP3 sound file \texttt{homepage.html}. Since many applications use
filename extensions to identify the \gl{MIME type}{g:mime-type} of
the file, misnaming files may cause those applications to fail.

\item[filesystem]:
A set of files, directories, and I/O devices (such
as keyboards and screens). A filesystem may be spread across many
physical devices, or many filesystems may be stored on a single physical
device; the \gl{operating system}{g:operating-system} manages
access.

\item[filter]:
A program that transforms a stream of data. Many Unix
command-line tools are written as filters: they read data from
\gl{standard input}{g:standard-input}, process it, and write the
result to \gl{standard output}{g:standard-output}.

\item[flag]:
A terse way to specify an option or setting to a
command-line program. By convention Unix applications use a dash
followed by a single letter, such as \texttt{-v}, or two dashes followed
by a word, such as \texttt{-{}-verbose}, while DOS applications use a
slash, such as \texttt{/V}. Depending on the application, a flag may be
followed by a single argument, as in \texttt{-o /tmp/output.txt}.

\item[floating point number]:

being assigned to is also an operand on the right hand side of the
assignment. For example, the statement \texttt{x += 3} means the same
thing as \texttt{x = x + 3}.

modify anything. Queries are expressed in a special-purpose language
called \gl{SQL}{g:sql}.

\item[quoting] (in the shell):
Using quotation marks of various kinds
to prevent the shell from interpreting special characters. For example,
